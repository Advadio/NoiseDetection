# NoiseDetection

Living in an urban environment often comes with a significant amount of noise, much of it caused by vehicle traffic. 
While there are regulations concerning noise, enforcement is challenging, and often sporadic and inconsistent. 
Cities have experimented with the installation of noise sensors that detect high noise levels, possibly in combination
with cameras that record the source of the noise.

The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI methods to detect high-level noise, categorize it, and pinpoint the location as narrowly as possible.
